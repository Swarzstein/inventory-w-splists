/*
To effectively manage concurrent access to SharePoint lists by multiple users and avoid conflicts, you can implement several best practices and strategies. Here’s how you can ensure smooth operation for your React application used by three employees simultaneously:

1. Leverage SharePoint's Built-in Conflict Handling
SharePoint provides built-in mechanisms for handling concurrent edits. When multiple users attempt to edit the same list item, SharePoint will manage these conflicts by notifying users of changes made by others. This means that if User A and User B try to edit the same item, SharePoint will alert them, allowing them to decide how to proceed.

2. Implement Refresh Mechanisms
To ensure that users are always working with the most current data, implement a refresh mechanism in your React application. This can be done by periodically fetching the latest data from the SharePoint lists or by providing a manual refresh button. This way, users can see updates made by others without needing to reload the entire application.
*/
const refreshData = async () => {
  // Fetch the latest data from SharePoint
  const latestData = await fetchDataFromSharePoint();
  setData(latestData); // Update the state with the latest data
};

/*
3. Use Optimistic UI Updates
When a user makes a change, you can optimistically update the UI to reflect that change immediately while the request is being processed. This enhances the user experience by making the application feel more responsive. However, you should also handle potential errors if the update fails due to a conflict.
*/
const updateItem = async (item) => {
  // Optimistically update the UI
  const updatedItems = items.map(i => (i.Id === item.Id ? { ...i, ...item } : i));
  setItems(updatedItems);

  try {
      await updateItemInSharePoint(item); // Send the update to SharePoint
  } catch (error) {
      // Handle error and revert the optimistic update if necessary
      console.error("Update failed:", error);
      // Optionally, fetch the latest data again to sync
      refreshData();
  }
};

/*
4. Implement Locking Mechanisms (if necessary)
For critical operations where data integrity is paramount, consider implementing a locking mechanism. This could involve setting a flag on an item when a user begins editing it, preventing others from making changes until the first user completes their edits. However, this approach can lead to user frustration if not managed carefully, so use it judiciously.

4.1. Add a Lock Field to Your SharePoint List
First, you need to modify your SharePoint list schema to include a field that indicates whether an item is locked. This could be a simple boolean field called IsLocked, or you could include a LockedBy field to track which user has locked the item.
IsLocked: Boolean (Yes/No)
LockedBy: Text (to store the user ID or name)

4.2. Locking an Item
When a user wants to edit an item, your application should first check if the item is locked. If it is not locked, you can proceed to lock it by updating the IsLocked field and optionally setting the LockedBy field.
Here’s a sample function to lock an item:
*/
const lockItem = async (itemId, userId) => {
  const item = await fetchItemFromSharePoint(itemId);
  
  if (!item.IsLocked) {
      // Lock the item
      await updateItemInSharePoint(itemId, {
          IsLocked: true,
          LockedBy: userId
      });
      return true; // Successfully locked
  } else {
      return false; // Item is already locked
  }
};

/*
4.3. Unlocking an Item
Once the user has finished editing, they should unlock the item. This can be done by updating the IsLocked field back to false and clearing the LockedBy field.
Here’s how you can implement the unlock function:
*/
const unlockItem = async (itemId, userId) => {
  const item = await fetchItemFromSharePoint(itemId);
  
  if (item.IsLocked && item.LockedBy === userId) {
      // Unlock the item
      await updateItemInSharePoint(itemId, {
          IsLocked: false,
          LockedBy: null
      });
      return true; // Successfully unlocked
  } else {
      return false; // Item is not locked by this user
  }
};

/**
4.4. Handling Conflicts
When a user tries to lock an item that is already locked, you should inform them that the item is currently being edited by another user. You can implement a notification system or a modal dialog to alert users.

4.5. Implementing a Timeout for Locks
To prevent items from being locked indefinitely (for example, if a user forgets to unlock), consider implementing a timeout mechanism. You can add a timestamp field called LockTimestamp to track when the item was locked. If the lock is older than a certain threshold (e.g., 15 minutes), you can automatically unlock it.

4.6. User Interface Considerations
Make sure your UI reflects the lock status of items. For example, disable the edit button for locked items and display a message indicating who has locked the item.
